The "fk_test.m" is a test file for doing forward kinematics. It take two set of configuration parameters, one for pose of desired end-effector and another for the initial pose. Then it calculate the forward kinematics for both of them.

The "dh_matrix.m" is a function that produces the DH_matrix.

The "inverse_kinematics.m" take in a desired position and initial position of the end-effector and do the inverse kinematics to find the joint space of the end-effector.
